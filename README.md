Solution Challenge
Hello, this is code for our arduino and needs a few things to get running. 
The first thing you need is the arduino IDE
The second is you need to install the following libraries to the arduino IDE: DHTliib, NewPing
The code can then be run and verified. You can run the code in the IDE or you may assemble your own arduino to test it as long as all the pins are followed.
